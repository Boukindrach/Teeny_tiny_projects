Welcome to the "Teeny_tiny_projects" Repository! 

This repository is dedicated to storing small programming projects that I create and will create form this day to the near futur as I'm learning and practicing Programming.

Projects such as the Bagels game which i just uploaded a few minutes ago for the "Big Book for small Python projects" and more to come.

if you want to practice and improve your programming skills in a fun and engaging way, building projects is the best thing you can do.

So I hope this Repository might help you one day, to create your first one, as I just did this day :)
